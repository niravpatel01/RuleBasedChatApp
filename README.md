About The Project
Provide a brief, compelling description of your chatbot application.

What does it do?

What problem does it solve?

What makes it unique?

Example:

This is a .NET Core Razor Pages application that implements a simple chatbot. The chatbot provides answers to user queries by retrieving information directly from a local Excel file. This project demonstrates a straightforward approach to creating a data-driven chatbot without relying on external NLP services, making it easy to manage and update its knowledge base. It's ideal for FAQs, internal knowledge bases, or simple interactive guides.

Features
List the key features of your application. Use bullet points for readability.

Example:

Excel-driven Knowledge Base: Easily update chatbot responses by modifying a local Excel file.

Razor Pages Interface: A clean and intuitive web interface built with .NET Core Razor Pages.

Keyword Matching: Basic keyword matching for answering user queries.

Responsive Design: (If applicable) The UI adapts to different screen sizes.

Simple Setup: Minimal dependencies for quick deployment and testing.

Getting Started
Instructions on how to set up and run your project locally.

Prerequisites
List any software or tools users need to have installed.

.NET SDK (Specify version, e.g., 8.0 or 6.0)

Bash

# Example: Check .NET SDK version
dotnet --version
(Optional, if you recommend a specific IDE) Visual Studio, VS Code with C# extension

Installation
Step-by-step guide to get the project running.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/niravpatel01/RuleBasedChatApp.git
cd RuleBasedChatApp
Restore NuGet packages:

Bash

dotnet restore
Update the Excel file (Optional but Recommended):

Navigate to the Data folder (or wherever your Excel file is located, e.g., wwwroot/data).

Open chatbot_data.xlsx (or your specific file name).

Familiarize yourself with the column structure (e.g., "Question", "Answer").

Add or modify questions and answers as needed.

Important: Ensure the Excel file format remains .xlsx and the sheet name matches what the application expects (if applicable, e.g., "Sheet1").

Run the application:

Bash

dotnet run
Access the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the console (e.g., https://localhost:7000 or http://localhost:5000).

Usage
Explain how to use the chatbot once it's running.

Example:

Once the application is running, you will see a chat interface. Type your questions into the input box and press Enter or click the "Send" button. The chatbot will then attempt to find a relevant answer from the loaded Excel file. If a direct match or a sufficiently close keyword match is found, the answer will be displayed. Otherwise, a default "I don't understand" message will appear.


Key Files:

Pages/Index.cshtml: The main UI for the chatbot.

Pages/Index.cshtml.cs: The code-behind for the chatbot page, handling user input and chatbot responses.

Data/chatbot_data.xlsx: The Excel file serving as the chatbot's knowledge base.

Services/ChatbotService.cs: (If you have a dedicated service) Contains the logic for reading the Excel file and processing queries.

Data Source
Specifically mention the Excel file and its expected format.

The chatbot's knowledge base is stored in an Excel file located at Data/chatbot_data.xlsx (adjust path if different).

Expected Excel Structure:
The Excel file should contain at least two columns:

Question: (or similar header) This column should contain the questions or keywords the chatbot should recognize.

Answer: (or similar header) This column should contain the corresponding answers the chatbot will provide.

You can add more columns if your application utilizes them, but these two are essential for the basic functionality. Ensure the sheet name is correctly referenced in the application's code if it's not the default "Sheet1".

Additional Tips for a Great README:
Screenshots/GIFs: If possible, include a screenshot or a short GIF of your chatbot in action. This can significantly enhance understanding and appeal. You can embed them directly in the README using Markdown.

Badges: Add badges at the top for things like build status, license, or technologies used. Shields.io is a great resource.

Future Enhancements: (Optional) If you have plans for future features, you can add a "Roadmap" or "Future Plans" section.

Testing: If you have unit tests or integration tests, mention how to run them.

Deployment: Briefly describe any deployment considerations if it's not just running locally.

Be Specific: Always replace placeholders like your_username, your_repository_name, your_email@example.com, etc., with your actual information.

Formatting: Use Markdown effectively with headings, bold text, italics, code blocks, and lists to make your README easy to read and navigate.

By following this comprehensive guide, your GitHub repository will have a professional, informative, and user-friendly README file that effectively communicates the purpose, functionality, and usage of your .NET Core Razor Pages chatbot application.
